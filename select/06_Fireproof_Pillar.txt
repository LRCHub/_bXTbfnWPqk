Here's a chance to show you how I feel
A chance for you to see it's real
To see just what I feel inside and who it is that's by my side
I will never change my mind
Try to torch me and you'll find
You can't turn me or deter me
No matter how you try
You can't burn me
I know where I stand and what will happen if you try it
I am fireproof
I know my heart and I just can't deny it
I am fireproof
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't be quiet
I am fireproof
I'll never bow down and you won't buy it
I am fireproof
Now you know what I'm all about
There's no chance I'll ever doubt
The only one who can control me
I extol the almighty
You want me to put it on the line
And give yield to you this time
See but I won't compromise and I realize
It's my time to rise
It's my time to rise
I know where I stand and what will happen if you try it
I am fireproof
I know my heart and I just can't deny it
I am fireproof
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't be quiet
I am fireproof
I'll never bow down and you won't buy it
I am fireproof
You'll never take me in the fire
You'll never take my own desire
You'll never take me in the fire
You'll never take my own desire
I know where I stand and what will happen if you try it
I am fireproof
I know my heart and I just can't deny it
I am fireproof
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't be quiet
I am fireproof
I'll never bow down and you won't buy it
I am fireproof
I know where I stand and what will happen if you try it
I am fireproof
I know my heart and I just can't deny it
I am fireproof
I tried to tell you but you wouldn't be quiet
I am fireproof
I'll never bow down and you won't buy it
I am fireproof
