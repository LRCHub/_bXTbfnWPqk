Did you know me and you
Must be fireproof with all the hell that we've been through??
When all our loving lost its charm
Learned to make a shelter out in the storm
Leave it out of the cold
Climbed the mountain then I stepped on burning coals
When all our loving fell apart
Someone left the light on out in the dark

You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof

We'll be fireproof

Did you know you and me
Must be fireproof with all these flames between our sheets?
When all our loving is almost gone
Made some in the moonlight, before the dawn
Leave it out of the heat
Crossed the desert and we sailed the seven seas
When all our loving felt so wrong
Found out all the hard times just made us strong (yeah)

You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof

We'll be fireproof

We'll be fireproof

We'll be fireproof

You and I, we've both been through hell and high water
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof tonight
There's a spark catching fire, feel it getting hotter
I'll be yours, you'll be mine, we'll be fireproof
